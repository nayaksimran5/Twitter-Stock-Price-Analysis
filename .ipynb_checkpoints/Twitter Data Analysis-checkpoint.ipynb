    "\n",
    "For this project, I will retrieve and analyze tweets related to major stock market trends and specific companies like Tesla ($TSLA), Apple ($AAPL), Amazon ($AMZN), and Microsoft ($MSFT). The tweets will be filtered based on stock-related hashtags such as #StockMarket, #Investing, #Trading, #TeslaStock, #AAPL, #Crypto, and relevant keywords like \"bullish,\" \"bearish,\" \"market crash,\" and \"price surge.\" \n",

    "By performing sentiment analysis on these tweets, I aim to quantify public opinion and correlate it with stock price fluctuations. The visualization will display sentiment trends, stock price movements, and trading volume patterns, helping investors and analysts understand how public sentiment influences the market. "
